	<intro>
		An introduction to nuclear reactions, nuclear reactors and their design.
	</intro>
	<procdesc>
		These machines are used to process existing materials into ones needed for making functional reactors.
	</procdesc>
	<gendesc>
		These machines harness the power of a nuclear reactor, and work together to convert it into usable shaft power.
	</gendesc>
	<htgrdesc>
		These are the components to a High-Temperature Gas Reactor (HTGR).
	</htgrdesc>
	<fissiondesc>
		These are the components to a standard boiling-water fission reactor.
	</fissiondesc>
	<breederdesc>
		These are the components to a sodium-cooled breeder reactor, or "liquid-metal fast breeder reactor" (LMFBR).
	</breederdesc>
	<thoriumdesc>
		These are the components to a liquid-fueled thorium reactor. These are fission reactors, but they are markedly different from other designs.
	</thoriumdesc>
	<fusiondesc>
		These are the components to a Tokamak fusion reactor.
	</fusiondesc>
	<accdesc>
		These machines are often required alongside the actual reactor, to produce or transport materials or to otherwise aid the reactors.
	</accdesc>
	<tooldesc>
		These tools are useful to those working with nuclear reactors.
	</tooldesc>
	<resourcedesc>
		These items are crucial in the operation of nuclear reactors.
